# terraform-dynamodb-export-to-s3
Terraform code to configure a lambda function to export DynamoDB table data to S3 on a recurring basis.

This terraform source code will provision a lambda function that is trigger by an event bridge on an hourly basis to export DynamoDB data to S3 on a recurring basis. To change the frequency you can update it via the `eventbridge.tf` file.
